# NYPD-Stop-and-Frisk

The NYPD is still stopping and frisking Black people at alarmingly disproportionate rates

I wanted to take a look at NYPD Stop and Frisk data for 2020 to see if there was any sort of noticeable dip during the BLM protests (end of May 2020). I was also interested to see the percent broken down by demographic. A lot has been brought to clear attention this past year and I am curious to see what the data behind NYPD looked like during such an important, impactful year. 
The demographics are broken down by: Black, White Hispanic, White, Black Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern/Southwest, American Indian/Alaskan. 

March 2020, stop and frisk reports were at their highest - 1,115 and dipped to their lowest in July 2020 at 388.



Stop and Frisk related data in 2020 was the lowest ever reported - 9,544, down from 13,549 in 2019 and 11,008 in 2018. 
Despite this massive drop, racial disparity still remains as clear as ever. I broke down the entire data set to get a general overview of the demographics. 
As you can see from the below chart, more than half the stop and frisks by NYPD in 2020 pertain to black people.

There were 9,544 reports in 2020 and 5,367 were Black New Yorkers, who represent 24% of the population and account for 56% of Stop and Risk reports. 



I was interested to see that while numbers of cases started to decrease at the end of May -- what did this look like in terms of the percentage of Black people being stopped?  
Did it change at all? 
Below is a chart where I broke down the total number of reports and highlighted at the end of the total, how many were related to Black people.
There isnâ€™t one month where the percent drops below 51% of total. 
So, even with a significant drop in reports, there is still a very high chance that an NYPD officer will stop a Black person.
